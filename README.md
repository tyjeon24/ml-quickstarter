# ml-quickstarter
If you are looking for code snippets for Machine Learning, rather than in-depth learning, you've come to the right place. This project caters to busy individuals who need simple code with specific purposes, ranging from data processing to AutoML.

# How Can I use this?
1. Go to the folder you want (I recommend starting with 'AutoML' first).
2. Click on the code file you want.
3. Copy and run it.
4. That's it!
